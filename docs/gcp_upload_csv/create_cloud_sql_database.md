# Create  CloudSQL Database

## Connect to MySQL database again

* we have created a running MysQL server running on new CloudSQL instance from GCP CloudShell
* ..but we have not yet created our database
* we got connected in two different ways:
    * **mysql -u root -p -h 34.44.240.91**
    * **gcloud sql connect myinstance --user=root**
